This project analyze data from the Bicycle Sales db provided by the datacamp team.
Objective:
The main objective of this project is to analyze bicycle sales and answer the following questions:
1. 多What are the top 3 most sold products, categories and brands?
2. 多Does the sales of a certain product change from store to store?
3. 多Who are the most loyal clients?
4. 多Which staff member made the most sales?

Tools:
The key tool used for this project is SQL. I combined subqueries, window functions and simple joins. 

Insights:
To present this information I used Power BI. The principal reason for doing this is that being able to handle data modeling of 9 tables is more efficient with Power BI. Besides, I think it can agreggate extra value to the project due to the versatility to make connections to different data sources, not to mention the cleaning data process.
